h1. HTTP_Server, a simple Web-Server written in PHP

h2. For what do I need this?

The possibilities are not obvious, though there are some Use-Cases for it:
 * You want to create a simple Web-Service with your Know-How of PHP and minimal Abstractions over HTTP
 * You want to mock a Web-Service and need a convenient Web-Server which also can run Assertions
 * You want a local Development Server without the Setup hassle, which Apache brings

h2. Requirements

HTTP_Server has following requirements:
 * PHP 5.3.x, _for stable, long running scripts_
 * Sockets enabled in PHP, though this should be on by default
 * If you're on *nix, the PCNTL Extension is a good Idea, as it provides better Performance
 * PEAR's Net_Server
